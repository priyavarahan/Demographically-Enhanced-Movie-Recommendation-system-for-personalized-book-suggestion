# Demographically-Enhanced-Movie-Recommendation-system-for-personalized-book-suggestion
Developed a movie recommendation system with AWS and machine learning to suggest personalized books, focusing on user demographics. The system used predictive models to tailor recommendation based on individual preferences.

The project focuses on identifying important features by analyzing the dataset, which is processed and cleaned using AWS Glue, PySpark, DataBrew, and Redshift. Machine learning algorithms, like K-Nearest-Neighbor, are applied for predicting book and movie recommendations using AWS SageMaker and Lambda functions.
